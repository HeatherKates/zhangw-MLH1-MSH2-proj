# RNAseq, ATACseq, and CUT&RUN Analysis for MSH2 and MLH1 in Tumor Metastasis

This repository contains scripts and files related to the analysis of RNAseq, ATACseq, and CUT&RUN data to investigate the contrasting roles of MSH2 and MLH1 in tumor metastasis.

## Overview

The code provided here is fully reproducible. Except for the original `fastq.gz` files, all other files and results can be recreated using the scripts included in this repository. Due to size constraints and data ownership, large files and non public files are omitted. For access to these files, please see the `.gitignore` and email [hkates@ufl.edu](mailto:hkates@ufl.edu).

To run these pipelines navigate to the hipergator directory of your choice and use `git clone https://github.com/HeatherKates/TanziaMLH1MSH2.git`

Each project is divided into subanalyses as it should be run. RNAseq and ATACseq are divided into MLH1 and MSH2 files. CUT&RUN is further divided into KO and R4 files.

Each analysis has a **data/** folder that contains a symlink to the actual location of the data on hipergator. 

## Getting started

Clone this repository to your directory of choice, e.g.

	`ssh hkates@hpg2.rc.ufl.edu`

	`cd /blue/zhangw/hkates`

	`git clone https://github.com/HeatherKates/TanziaMLH1MSH2.git`
	
**ALL SCRIPTS SHOULD BE RUN FROM THE MAIN ANALYSIS DIRECTORY.**

	`cd TanziaMLH1MSH2/RNAseq`

	`nano scripts/1a_fastqc.sbatch` to change resource requests (or edit another way)

	`sbatch scripts/1a_fastqc.sbatch`	

**MAKE SURE THAT YOU CHANGE THE HIPERGATOR RESOURSE REQUESTS IN ANY .SBATCH FILES**

Nothing else needs to be changed

**Run .sbatch scripts by typing `sbatch FILENAME`**

**Run .R scripts by typing `module load R` and then `Rscript FILENAME`**

**Executing scripts may create directories and files in the respective results/ folders. These will overwrite any existing files. If you wish to re-run an analysis *without* over-writing files, rename the directory and reclone the repo before starting again.**

# ATAC-seq Pipeline Summary

This pipeline processes ATAC-seq data starting from raw FASTQ files through trimming, alignment, peak calling, and differential binding analysis. Below is a summary of each step and the associated input/output files.

## Step 1: Trim Galore

Runs Trim Galore to remove adapter sequences from the raw FASTQ files.

**Input Files:**
  - Raw FASTQ files (`R1` and `R2`) for each lane:
    - Example: `231-MLH1KO-1_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz`, `231-MLH1KO-1_S1_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz`

**Output Files:**
  - Trimmed FASTQ files for each lane:
    - Example: `MLH1KO-1_L001_val_1.fq.gz`, `MLH1KO-1_L001_val_2.fq.gz`
  - Trimming report files:
    - Example: `231-MLH1KO-1_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz_trimming_report.txt`

## Step 2: FastQC (Pre- and Post-trimming)

Runs FastQC on both raw and trimmed FASTQ files to assess read quality.

**Input Files:**
  - Raw FASTQ files (`R1`, `R2`) for each lane
  - Trimmed FASTQ files (`val_1.fq.gz`, `val_2.fq.gz`)

**Output Files:**
  - FastQC HTML reports:
    - Example: `231-MLH1KO-1_S1_L001_R1_001_fastqc.html`
  - FastQC data files (`fastqc_data.txt` inside the `.zip`):
    - Example: `231-MLH1KO-1_S1_L001_R1_001_fastqc.zip`

## Step 3: Bowtie2 Alignment

Aligns trimmed reads to the reference genome using Bowtie2.

**Input Files:**
  - Trimmed FASTQ files from Trim Galore:
    - Example: `MLH1KO-1_L001_val_1.fq.gz`, `MLH1KO-1_L001_val_2.fq.gz`

**Output Files:**
  - SAM alignment files:
    - Example: `MLH1KO-1.sam`

## Step 4: Samtools Processing

Converts SAM to BAM, applies filtering, and sorts BAM files for downstream analysis.

**Input Files:**
  - SAM alignment files:
    - Example: `MLH1KO-1.sam`

  - Filtered and sorted BAM files:
    - Example: `MLH1KO-1.sorted.bam`

**Input Files:**
  - Filtered and sorted BAM files from Samtools:
    - Example: `MLH1KO-1.sorted.bam`

**Output Files:**
  - NarrowPeak files (peak regions):
    - Example: `MLH1KO-1.narrowPeak`

## Step 6: BigWig Generation

Creates BigWig files from BAM files for visualization in genome browsers.

**Input Files:**
  - Filtered and sorted BAM files from Samtools:
    - Example: `MLH1KO-1.sorted.bam`

**Output Files:**
  - BigWig files for visualization:
    - Example: `MLH1KO-1.bw`

## Step 7: Differential Binding Analysis with DiffBind

Performs differential binding analysis between groups (e.g., KO vs WT) using DiffBind.

**Input Files:**
  - NarrowPeak files for each sample:
    - Example: `MLH1KO-1.narrowPeak`
  - BAM files for each sample:
    - Example: `MLH1KO-1.sorted.bam`

# CUT&RUN Pipeline Summary

This directory contains the CUT&RUN pipeline files and scripts to analyze the roles of MSH2 and MLH1 in tumor metastasis. Below is an overview of the main folders and the contents within each directory.

CUT&RUN analysis is performed using the nf-core/cutandrun pipeline https://github.com/nf-core/cutandrun/tree/master, so scripts are minimal and directory output structure follows https://nf-co.re/cutandrun/3.2.2/results/cutandrun/results-6e1125d4fee4ea7c8b70ed836bb0e92a89e3305f/.
